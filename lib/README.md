## Documentation

A recently updated, [full documentation can be found here](https://raw.githack.com/phorward/phorward/master/doc/phorward.html), and is also locally available after installation.

## Building

Building *phorward* is simple as every GNU-style open source program. Extract the downloaded release tarball or clone the source repository into a directory of your choice.

Then, run

```bash
./configure
make
make install
```

And you're ready to go!

### Alternative development build

Alternatively, there is also a simpler method for setting up a local build system for development and testing purposes.

To do so, type

```bash
make -f Makefile.gnu make_install
make
```

This locally compiles the library or parts of it, and is ideal for development purposes.

### Stand-alone copy

The entire library including its tools can be made available in one target directory by using the script `./standalone.sh`.

This makes stand-alone integration of the entire library into other projects possible without a previous installation or porting, and easier maintainable packages.

The generated stand-alone package contains a `Makefile` and can directly be built.

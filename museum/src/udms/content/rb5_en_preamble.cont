rb5_en_preamble_1.html§What is RapidBATCH?§Welcome to RapidBATCH!<br><br><!-- br -->RapidBATCH is a popular scripting language for Windows&reg; platforms, which goal is the fast and uncomplicated solution of smaller and median software-problems today's computer users are dealing with. For this, RapidBATCH follows its own, simple philosophy: Getting a great result with less of coding effort!<br><br><!-- br --><!-- br --><!-- br -->Already the following, two lines are representing an adequate, in RapidBATCH implemented software-program.<br><!-- br --><!-- br --><br><!-- br -->[code]echo <font color="#0000ff">'Hello World'</font><br /><!-- br --><b>end</b>[/code]<!-- br --><br><!-- br --><br><!-- br --><!-- br --><!--<!-- br -->Indeed, many RapidBATCH programs - the so called scripts - are hold very plainly, but under the <!-- br -->&quot;engine hood&quot; of the scripts, very effective and powerful mechanism are used, making their usage very versatile and efficient. Nearly every software-problem can be solved within a couple of minutes using RapidBATCH - it is just a question of the implementation.<br><br><!-- br -->--><!-- br --><!-- br -->RapidBATCH provides everything you need for the quick development of smaller and greater programs (and especially for extended batch file programming): Files can be created, read, written, copied, moved, renamed and deleted, file permissions and file dates can be read and changed, external programs can be executed in different modes, the registry can be modified and read, Windows&reg; can be shut down or locked, programs can be controlled remotely, mouse-clicks and movements can be simulated, multimedia files like MP3, AVI or MIDI can be played, documents and internet-urls can be called and opened.<br><br><!-- br -->Additionally, RapidBATCH provides you 10 build-in dialog windows for different user-interaction possibilites that can be directly used in every script. Using over 12 different window controls, you're also able to create and program your very own, completely individual dialogs, enabling you to implement any desired user interface you wish into your scripts and applications.<!-- br --><br><!-- br --><br><!-- br -->As a modern, procedural programming language, RapidBATCH provides also on the technical level all you need to implement powerful tools and applications with less programming effort: A clearly structured and flexible syntax, easy learnable statements and functions, iterations (loops), many build-in functions to operate with data, user-definable procedures and functions, recoursive programming (self-calling procedures), a completely, ultra dynamic variable system, featuring arrays with up to 9 sub-dimensions, and the possiblity of include-files, where different script code parts and procedure- or function-definitions can be separated into different files, that are assembled together virtually to one huge script at run-time.<!-- br --><br><!-- br --><br><!-- br --><!-- br -->RapidBATCH is very easy to learn, both for programming beginners and for experienced users or software developers, who want to have a professional, fast and versatile scripting platform to their fingertips.<br><!-- br -->RapidBATCH scripts can be directly executed with a simple double-click on the script file, like at an EXE- or batchfile-program. No project directories or makefiles are required as they are known from huger software development environments.<!-- br --><br><br><!-- br --><!-- br -->To execute scripts, RapidBATCH uses a script-interpreter, that reads the script's sources in plain text and directly executes them. For those programmers who want to pass and deploy their programs to other users, the fast RapidBATCH script-compiler can be used to compile the scripts into standalone, self-executable .EXE-files, that can be executed on any Windows&reg; platform without a RapidBATCH interpreter or development environment.<!-- br --><br><br><!-- br --><!-- br -->Also when creating your scripts, RapidBATCH makes it as easy as possible: The included script-editor RapidBATCH Builder allows the comfortable editing and creation of RapidBATCH scripts, which can directly be executed and compiled from the editor. With the powerful script-debugger that is integrated into the RapidBATCH-interpreter, you can execute your scripts line-by-line to trace the program flow and watch or change to content of variables directly at run-time. Thus, RapidBATCH provides you an useful tool to find logical bugs in your scripts very quickly.<!-- br --><br><!-- br --><br><!-- br --><!-- br -->This manual will introduce you step-by-step to the development of scripts in RapidBATCH 5. Because RapidBATCH has grown to a handsome and powerful programming language now, this manual will only discuss the most important elements and language features. In addition, the detailed language reference manual provides an excellent appendix to the scripting language, describing all functions and statements RapidBATCH is featuring, including a full description and examples.<!-- br --><br><!-- br --><br><!-- br --><!-- br -->Now, we wish you much fun and success with RapidBATCH! Thank you, that you decided to use RapidBATCH for your scripting ideas.
rb5_en_preamble_2.html§What's new in Version 5?§With the new version 5 of the scripting language RapidBATCH, a new era begins in the most popular product that ever has been release by <i>J.M.K S.F. Software Technologies</i>.<br><!-- br --><!-- br -->RapidBATCH 5 is set-up on a new technology, based on the know how that has been collected with RapidBATCH 4, and has been completely revised and enhanced to powerful functionalities within a development and test period of nearly two years. So RapidBATCH can not be seen as just a batch-language anymore, it also became a powerful, flexible and efficient development system for smaller and huger applications of any kind now.<br><br><!-- br --><!-- br -->And now, the new, unbeatable features RapidBATCH 5.0 provides in contrast to RapidBATCH 4.4.<br><!-- br --><!-- br -->Please note that some of these features do not fit to the free &quot;Personal Edition&quot; of the RapidBATCH scripting platform.<!-- br --><!-- br --><ul><!-- br -->  <li>60% faster script execution than in RapidBATCH 4.4, due to the new memory management and re-designed framework.</li><!-- br -->  <li>99% downward compatible with RapidBATCH 4.4: RapidBATCH 4.4 scripts can be executed and compiled in a RapidBATCH 5.0 scripting environment with nearly no changes.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Revised variable system: Now, RapidBATCH supports real arrays with up to 9 sub-dimensions. An array can be dynamically created from any RapidBATCH variable, values can be stored into every dimension and index, also if the array dimension the value is stored to contains another sub-dimension!</li><!-- br -->  <li>Fully dynamic, internal memory management: All the internal, static functionalities which had been assumed from RapidBATCH 4 are now completely dynamic.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Variables and arrays can be resetted and cleared using the new RESET-statement. Also, the reset of single array sub-dimensions is possible using this statement.</li><!-- br -->  <li>User-defineable procedures and functions can now be implemented and used in RapidBATCH scripts. This enables real, procedural programming logics with nested procedure calls, and recoursions. Variables can be passed over the call-by-value and over the call-by-reference methods.</li><!-- br -->  <li>The six RapidBATCH-operators (+, -, *, /, ~ and #) can now be used everywhere where an expression is required. Also, brackets can now be used to define formulas more faster and efficient now.</li><!-- br -->    <li>Improved conditional operators greater-equal (&gt;=) and lower-equal (&lt;=) (included in RapidBATCH v5.0.5 and higher).</li><!-- br -->  <li>Implementation of Quick-Assignments: By using one of the RapidBATCH operators instead of the equal-sign (=) in an assignment, the specified operator directly includes the variable that receives the value of the expression into the expression itself. This feature saves much characters of code and can be greatly used to e.g. increment a value within a loop or to join strings together from different code lines into one, huge string variable.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Dynamic calls of labels via GOTO and GOSUB: The name of the label GOTO or GOSUB should jump to can now be completely dynamic, so a variable can be passed to these statements.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Virtual merging of script files: Using the statements INCLUDE and INCLUDE_ONCE, RapidBATCH script files can now be assembled virtually together into one, huge script file that is executed or compiled. This powerful possibility enables the definition and use of function- and procedure-libraries that are once defined and then imported into different script-files using these importing statements.</li><!-- br -->  <li>New build-in dialog TRAYMENU, providing a system-tray menu in the Windows task bar.</li><!-- br -->  <li>New build-in dialog PWDBOX to provide a masked prompting dialog to let the user enter passwords.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Extending iteration control statements BREAK and CONT to break and to continue REPEAT...UNTIL-iterations.<li><!-- br -->  <li>Extended, character-oriented file processing using GETFILE and PUTFILE, for binary files.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Using the new functionalities NEWDIALOG, LETDIALOG, GETDIALOG, DELDIALOG and RUNDIALOG, it is now possible to design and provide completely individual, user-defined application windows and dialogs within your RapidBATCH scripts. This powerful features lifts RapidBATCH up to a fully-fledged, high-level programming language for Windows applications of any kind! RapidBATCH provides 17 different dialog-elements, the so called &quot;Widgets&quot;, that can be completely dynamically created and set-up. Each widget provides attributes that can be changed and events, on that the script can execute corresponding code.<!-- br -->  <li>Build-in registry-processing functionalities with NEWREGKEY, DELREGKEY, LETREGVAL, GETREGVAL and DELREGVAL.</li><!-- br -->  <li>New, extending build-in system-specific functionalities DISKFREE, DISKSIZE, DISKTYPE, LOCKWORKSTATION and SHUTDOWN.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Creating document and program shortcuts using the SHORTCUT-instruction.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Control the mouse remotely using the MOUSEEVENT-instruction, receive and set the mouse-positions using the pre-declared variables [mouse_x] and [mouse_y].</li><!-- br -->  <li>New build-in functions CNTVAR, to receive the amount a sub-string appears within a string, and GETCHARAT to receive the character at a specified position from a string.</li><!-- br -->  <li>The MSGBOX-instruction can now also be used as a function, returning the value to a return variable that is returned to [errorcode] in case of when MSGBOX is called as an instruction. This has been done because MSGBOX should be used more oftenly as a function in the future, but also, the backward compatibility to RapidBATCH 4.4 should be hold up.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Extended possibilities for GETTOK, GETPOS, REPLACEVAR and CNTVAR using the variable [case_sensitivity]. This variables switches if these functions should differ between sub-strings with different case orders or not.</li><!-- br -->  <li>By setting the variable [std_sep] to any desired character, the global default-separator (the pipe-character (|)) can now be changed to all functionalities processing lists or expecting values with separation characters, for example LISTBOX or FINDFILES. By default, the character defined in [std_sep] is always the pipe-character.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Introducion of the pseudo-variable [null] that is used to receive irrellevant data from a function. If a value is assined to [null], it is not stored into the memory. Also when reading out [null], it always returns an empty string, so it can be passed instead of '' to procedures or functions.</li><!-- br -->  <li>New variables [true] and [false] as substitutions for '0' and '-1', e.g. when defining conditions, [a] = [true] is more significant than [a] = '0'.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Determine the title of the currently activated application window by reading out [active_window].</li><!-- br -->  <li>Change the icon displayed in the upper-left corner of build-in dialogs globally using the [app_icon] variable.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Definition of a default file-extension for the build-in dialogs OPENBOX and SAVEBOX using the variables [OpenBox_DefFileExt] und [SaveBox_DefFileExt].</li><!-- br -->  <li>New, pre-declared help variables for special characters: [crlf] for carriage return with line feed, [tab] for a tabulator character, [pipe] for the pipe-character and [quot] for a single quotation mark.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Especially for Windows XP and Windows 2003: The variables [XPStyleActive], [Metric_Edge_Width], [Metric_Edge_Height], [Metric_Caption_Height] and [Metric_Menu_Height] to optimize user-defined dialogs for Windows XP theme look&amp;feel.<!-- br -->  <li>Extended RapidBATCH functionalities that had been implemented in RapidBATCH itself are provided within seven different libraries (e.g. array-processing functions, extending system and string processing functions, extending dialog development functions, other universal-dialogs, and much more). These libraries can be imported to any script by using the INCLUDE-instruction.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Improved build-in script debugger with procedure-step functionality and more easier handling.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Completely new-designed script editor <i>RapidBATCH Builder</i> with obviously faster syntax highlighting and many new functions, e.g. the file history, a user-configurable tools menu and a multi-line commenting function.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Even some parts of the RapidBATCH software-package are implemented in RapidBATCH itself, e.g. the RapidBATCH Builder's tool menu configuration program, the Visual Dialog Designer that helps to design and generate dialogs in RapidBATCH very quickly and efficiently by placing widgets visually on the dialog, or the HTML Script-Code Highlighter RB-to-Web, generating the HTML-code for a highlighted RapidBATCH script source code that can be embedded into web pages.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Completely rewritten, detailed user's manual as an online help manual, providing a language reference that is both alphabetically sorted and sorted by topics. Also, all RapidBATCH script-code listings and examples are now provided in a highlighted form now.</li><!-- br -->  <li>It is now possible to link any desired program icon (even Windows XP styled icons with 256 colors and a size of 64x64 Pixels) to a compiled script, there is no limitation anymore than in RapidBATCH 4.4 Professional.</li><!-- br -->  <li>RapidBATCH 5 is also running on all Windows-versions starting from Windows 95 anymore, but was especially optimized for the usage on Windows 2000 and Windows XP.</li><!-- br --></ul><!-- br --><!-- br -->With these numerous reforms, RapidBATCH had been lifted-up to a platform for the development and solution of different problems and requirements. To those who updated from RapidBATCH 4.x to RapidBATCH 5, I strongly recommend to read the whole manual anyway from the beginning. RapidBATCH 5 and the new manual provide so many nice tips and enhancement, that do not fit to the programming flow and style RapidBATCH 4 provided.

rb5_en_preamble_5.html§Improvements in Version 5.1§The current release 5.1 comes with numerous smaller bug- and hotfixes, and makes RapidBATCH more flexible and more proliferous than before.<!-- br --><!-- br --><ul><!-- br -->  <li>New progress-bar widget: Show the user the current progress of some operation graphical on your self-defined dialogs.</li><!-- br -->  <li>New STATIC_COMBO-Widget: This widget provides a combo-box-like widget with the only difference that this widget does not allow the change of a selected item - so the values to be selected are static.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Re-designed macro-language for the SENDKEYS-instruction. Write keystroke automation scripts in a more easier, powerful way now than before. Please note: The new macro language is now backward-compatible, so old scripts need to be rewritten.</li><!-- br --> <li>Experimental implementation of the EXT-statement: Via the EXT-statement, it is possible to call external functions from Windows DLL-files - that can be created in any huger programming language like C or Pascal - using a special function interface format. This feature makes it possible to let developers design extending or special libraries that can be called and used from any RapidBATCH script.</li><!-- br -->  <li>Even to let external DLLs functions, which can be called over a special interface in future versions (this is already implemented for testing purposes in v5.0.5!) access widgets created and running in the RapidBATCH scripting environment, GETDIALOG allows the access of the attributes HWND (for the Windows internal window handle) and TYPE (to retrieve the widget's control type) now. Especially the HWND value can then be passed to an external function and perform a desired operation on the widget.</li><!-- br -->  <li>GETFILEATT-problem solved in EXE-files.</li><!-- br -->  <li>RapidBATCH Builder freeze-problem solved which happened when searching an already changed text pattern</li><!-- br --></ul>

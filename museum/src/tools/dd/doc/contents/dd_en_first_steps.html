		This chapter will demonstrate you, how a simple dialog window is created and designed, using the Visual Dialog Designer.<br /><br />When Dialog Designer is started, it first asks for a widget-name for the dialog basis window. When this dialog is confirmed with the desired (or even the suggested) value, create a new button-widget by selecting the corresponding icon from the toolbar or over the Create-Menu. Another input-box appears, where you need to enter the desired name for the new button widget. &quot;MyWidget1&quot; is suggested automatically by the program.<div class="image"><img src="img/dd_newwidget.gif" alt="Entering the widget-name for a new BUTTON-typed widget." /><br />Entering the widget-name for new button-typed widget to be created</div>The newly created button immediatelly appears in the upper-left corner of the designer window, and is automatically set as the current widget in the widget-list. Now, select the mode &quot;Move widget&quot; from the mode-area. The mouse-cursor is set to the lower-right corner of the widget. By moving the mouse, you're automatically moving the widget now to any desired pixel position on the designer's dialog window. To place it and leave the mode, just single left-click the mouse at the position you want to leave the button, and it is placed there.<div class="image"><img src="img/dd_movewidget.gif" alt="Moving the widget on the designer screen." /><br />Moving and placing the button on the designer-window using the mouse</div>The widget can also be placed and adjusted by entering the desired screen coordinates, in pixels, into the corresponding input-fields on the widget-editor.<br /><br />As easy as moving and placing a widget, it can also be scaled with the mouse. To do this, select the &quot;Scale widget&quot;-mode from the mode-area. Again, the mouse cursor is set to the lower-right corner of the widget. Now, you can scale the widget to any desired size on the designer's window. You apply your desired size and leave the mode again by a single left-click with the mouse.<div class="image"><img src="img/dd_sizewidget.gif" alt="Scaling the widget on the designer screen." /><br />Scaling the button on the designer-window using the mouse</div>At least, let's give the button a caption. Select the CAPTION-attribute from the attribute-list below the coordinates-information area. An input-field appears and is automatically focussed. Now you can enter any desired caption value. You can see: The caption is showed character-by-character on-line on the button when you enter it.<div class="image"><img src="img/dd_attribute1.gif" alt="Setting a widget's caption." /><br />Setting the button's caption</div>That's it! You see: Creating and designing dialogs using the Visual Dialog Designer is only a piece of cake.<br /><br />

		The RapidBATCH Visual Dialog Designer is the first, huger software-projekt of J.M.K S.F. Software Technologies that is completely implemented in the RapidBATCH scripting platform. Same as RapidBATCH 5.0 itself, also the Visual Dialog Designer will be continuosly further developed and extended to new functionalities.<br />The RapidBATCH source code of the designer is open and can be viewed and changed or edited for personal purposes at any time. To make the script very compact, the whole program was implemented into one single .RB script file, and exists of over 2800 lines of RapidBATCH code.<br /><br />Most parts of the Visual Dialog Designer had been written modularly. Modules, e.g. like the menu-editor or the item-editor, are implemented as procedures and functions and can be simply called and used.<br /><br />Your extensions on the program for the general public are always welcome, if you disclaim for a copyright and release your extensions als &quot;Public Domain&quot; (copyright-less). The copyright and intellectual property on the program belongs to J.M.K S.F., Jan Max Meyer. Please contact J.M.K S.F. Software Technologies via <a href="mailto:mail@jmksf.com">mail@jmksf.com</a>, if you want to release your extensions to the public within the next version of RapidBATCH Visual Dialog Designer. When creating such extensions, please respect the programming-style that is already used so far.Sincerely<br /><br />Jan Max Meyer<br /><br />

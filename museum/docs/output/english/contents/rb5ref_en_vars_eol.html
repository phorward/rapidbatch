				<td>The [eol] variable (eol = end of line) is used by the WRITEFILE instruction as end-of-line delimiter. This can be any desired string. By default, [eol] is set to carriage-return with line-feed (also contained by the variable [crlf]. By setting [eol] to [new_line] or any desired character or even string, WRITEFILE can also write files for Unix- and MAC-based systems, or into a personal file format.</td>

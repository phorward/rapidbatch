				<td>If [OpenBox_MultiSel] (for the build-in OPENBOX-dialog) resp. [SaveBox_MultiSel] (for the build-in SAVEBOX-dialog) is set to the value '0' (or [true]), a multiple file selection is possible in the particular dialog.<br /><br />In this case, the functions are returning a list of files that where selected by the user, which is formatted in the following order: &quot;Absolute Path to the Files|Filename 1|Filename 2|Filename 3 ...&quot;. Please note, that the pipe-character can be another one than pipe, based on the definition that was set to the [std_sep] default separation variable. If only one filename was selected, and multiple file selection is switched on, the whole absolute filename is returned.<br /><br />[OpenBox_DefFileExt] and [SaveBox_DefFileExt] have the purpose to define a default file extension that is automatically appended to a filename the user entered in the dialog's text field. The variables can be set to any desired file extension for the particular dialog. By default, they are empty.</td>

				<td>Provides the access to the Windows&reg; clipboard.<br /><br />When a value is assigned to [clipboard], it is automatically shared to all currently running applications of the current session, and can be pasted everywhere.<br />When [clipboard] is read, the value that is currently provided by another application is read from the clipboard, and can be used within the script.<br /><br />Please note, that only text information can be set and read to and from the clipboard. If a value was copied to the clipboard which is no text (e.g. a picture), [clipboard] returns an empty string when it is read.</td>

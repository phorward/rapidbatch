				<td>The variable [std_sep] defines the global standard-list separator.<br />This is a character, that is used to separate items of in a so called list, a string where different items are separated by this character. By default, this is the pipe-character. To make RapidBATCH more dynamic when processing lists, [std_sep] has been introduced with RapidBATCH version 5.0.<br /><br />Note, that only one character can be set. If [std_sep] is set to a string containing more than one character, only the first character will be used as separator.</td>

		With the new version 5 of the scripting language RapidBATCH, a new era begins in the most popular product that ever has been release by <i>J.M.K S.F. Software Technologies</i>.<br />RapidBATCH 5 is set-up on a new technology, based on the know how that has been collected with RapidBATCH 4, and has been completely revised and enhanced to powerful functionalities within a development and test period of nearly two years. So RapidBATCH can not be seen as just a batch-language anymore, it also became a powerful, flexible and efficient development system for smaller and huger applications of any kind now.<br /><br />And now, the new, unbeatable features RapidBATCH 5.0 provides in contrast to RapidBATCH 4.4.<br />Please note that some of these features do not fit to the free &quot;Personal Edition&quot; of the RapidBATCH scripting platform.<ul>  <li>60% faster script execution than in RapidBATCH 4.4, due to the new memory management and re-designed framework.</li>  <li>90% downward compatible with RapidBATCH 4.4: RapidBATCH 4.4 scripts can be executed and compiled in a RapidBATCH 5.0 scripting environment with nearly no changes.</li>  <li>Revised variable system: Now, RapidBATCH supports real arrays with up to 9 sub-dimensions. An array can be dynamically created from any RapidBATCH variable, values can be stored into every dimension and index, also if the array dimension the value is stored to contains another sub-dimension!</li>  <li>Fully dynamic, internal memory management: All the internal, static functionalities which had been assumed from RapidBATCH 4 are now completely dynamic.</li>  <li>Variables and arrays can be resetted and cleared using the new RESET-statement. Also, the reset of single array sub-dimensions is possible using this statement.</li>  <li>User-defineable procedures and functions can now be implemented and used in RapidBATCH scripts. This enables real, procedural programming logics with nested procedure calls, and recoursions. Variables can be passed over the call-by-value and over the call-by-reference methods.</li>  <li>The six RapidBATCH-operators (+, -, *, /, ~ and #) can now be used everywhere where an expression is required. Also, brackets can now be used to define formulas more faster and efficient now.</li>  <li>Point- before line-calculation is now finally implemented to all mathematical expressions (included in RapidBATCH v5.1.0 and higher).</li>  <li>Improved conditional operators greater-equal (&gt;=) and lower-equal (&lt;=) (included in RapidBATCH v5.0.5 and higher).</li>  <li>Implementation of Quick-Assignments: By using one of the RapidBATCH operators instead of the equal-sign (=) in an assignment, the specified operator directly includes the variable that receives the value of the expression into the expression itself. This feature saves much characters of code and can be greatly used to e.g. increment a value within a loop or to join strings together from different code lines into one, huge string variable.</li>  <li>Dynamic calls of labels via GOTO and GOSUB: The name of the label GOTO or GOSUB should jump to can now be completely dynamic, so a variable can be passed to these statements.</li>  <li>Virtual merging of script files: Using the statements INCLUDE and INCLUDE_ONCE, RapidBATCH script files can now be assembled virtually together into one, huge script file that is executed or compiled. This powerful possibility enables the definition and use of function- and procedure-libraries that are once defined and then imported into different script-files using these importing statements.</li>  <li>New build-in dialog TRAYMENU, providing a system-tray menu in the Windows task bar.</li>  <li>New build-in dialog PWDBOX to provide a masked prompting dialog to let the user enter passwords.</li>  <li>Extending iteration control statements BREAK and CONT to break and to continue REPEAT...UNTIL-iterations.<li>  <li>Extended, character-oriented file processing using GETFILE and PUTFILE, for binary files.</li>  <li>Using the new functionalities NEWDIALOG, LETDIALOG, GETDIALOG, DELDIALOG and RUNDIALOG, it is now possible to design and provide completely individual, user-defined application windows and dialogs within your RapidBATCH scripts. This powerful features lifts RapidBATCH up to a fully-fledged, high-level programming language for Windows applications of any kind! RapidBATCH provides 17 different dialog-elements, the so called &quot;Widgets&quot;, that can be completely dynamically created and set-up. Each widget provides attributes that can be changed and events, on that the script can execute corresponding code.  <li>Build-in registry-processing functionalities with NEWREGKEY, DELREGKEY, LETREGVAL, GETREGVAL and DELREGVAL.</li>  <li>New, extending build-in system-specific functionalities DISKFREE, DISKSIZE, DISKTYPE, LOCKWORKSTATION and SHUTDOWN.</li>  <li>Creating document and program shortcuts using the SHORTCUT-instruction.</li>  <li>Control the mouse remotely using the MOUSEEVENT-instruction, receive and set the mouse-positions using the pre-declared variables [mouse_x] and [mouse_y].</li>  <li>New build-in functions CNTVAR, to receive the amount a sub-string appears within a string, and GETCHARAT to receive the character at a specified position from a string.</li>  <li>The MSGBOX-instruction can now also be used as a function, returning the value to a return variable that is returned to [errorcode] in case of when MSGBOX is called as an instruction. This has been done because MSGBOX should be used more oftenly as a function in the future, but also, the backward compatibility to RapidBATCH 4.4 should be hold up.</li>  <li>Extended possibilities for GETTOK, GETPOS, REPLACEVAR and CNTVAR using the variable [case_sensitivity]. This variables switches if these functions should differ between sub-strings with different case orders or not.</li>  <li>A completely re-designed keystroke definition language for the SENDKEYS-instruction (included in RapidBATCH v5.1.0 and higher).</li>  <li>Call to external, user-defined functions using the EXT-function that acts as an interface to external Dynamic Link Library files. This possibiliy enables unlimited individualization of scripting powerful applications fastly and easily (included in RapidBATCH v5.1.0 and higher).</li>  <li>By setting the variable [std_sep] to any desired character, the global default-separator (the pipe-character (|)) can now be changed to all functionalities processing lists or expecting values with separation characters, for example LISTBOX or FINDFILES. By default, the character defined in [std_sep] is always the pipe-character.</li>  <li>Introducion of the pseudo-variable [null] that is used to receive irrellevant data from a function. If a value is assined to [null], it is not stored into the memory. Also when reading out [null], it always returns an empty string, so it can be passed instead of '' to procedures or functions.</li>  <li>New variables [true] and [false] as substitutions for '0' and '-1', e.g. when defining conditions, [a] = [true] is more significant than [a] = '0'.</li>  <li>Determine the title of the currently activated application window by reading out [active_window].</li>  <li>Change the icon displayed in the upper-left corner of build-in dialogs globally using the [app_icon] variable.</li>  <li>Definition of a default file-extension for the build-in dialogs OPENBOX and SAVEBOX using the variables [OpenBox_DefFileExt] und [SaveBox_DefFileExt].</li>  <li>New, pre-declared help variables for special characters: [crlf] for carriage return with line feed, [tab] for a tabulator character, [pipe] for the pipe-character and [quot] for a single quotation mark.</li>  <li>Especially for Windows XP and Windows 2003: The variables [XPStyleActive], [Metric_Edge_Width], [Metric_Edge_Height], [Metric_Caption_Height] and [Metric_Menu_Height] to optimize user-defined dialogs for Windows XP theme look&amp;feel.  <li>Extended RapidBATCH functionalities that had been implemented in RapidBATCH itself are provided within seven different libraries (e.g. array-processing functions, extending system and string processing functions, extending dialog development functions, other universal-dialogs, and much more). These libraries can be imported to any script by using the INCLUDE-instruction.</li>  <li>Improved build-in script debugger with procedure-step functionality and more easier handling.</li>  <li>Completely new-designed script editor <i>RapidBATCH Builder</i> with obviously faster syntax highlighting and many new functions, e.g. the file history, a user-configurable tools menu and a multi-line commenting function.</li>  <li>Even some parts of the RapidBATCH software-package are implemented in RapidBATCH itself, e.g. the RapidBATCH Builder's tool menu configuration program, the Visual Dialog Designer that helps to design and generate dialogs in RapidBATCH very quickly and efficiently by placing widgets visually on the dialog, or the HTML Script-Code Highlighter RB-to-Web, generating the HTML-code for a highlighted RapidBATCH script source code that can be embedded into web pages.</li>  <li>Completely rewritten, detailed user's manual as an online help manual, providing a language reference that is both alphabetically sorted and sorted by topics. Also, all RapidBATCH script-code listings and examples are now provided in a highlighted form now.</li>  <li>It is now possible to link any desired program icon (even Windows XP styled icons with 256 colors and a size of 64x64 Pixels) to a compiled script, there is no limitation anymore than in RapidBATCH 4.4 Professional.</li>  <li>RapidBATCH 5 is also running on all Windows-versions starting from Windows 95 anymore, but was especially optimized for the usage on Windows 2000 and Windows XP.</li></ul>With these numerous reforms, RapidBATCH had been lifted-up to a platform for the development and solution of different problems and requirements. To those who updated from RapidBATCH 4.x to RapidBATCH 5, I strongly recommend to read the whole manual anyway from the beginning. RapidBATCH 5 and the new manual provide so many nice tips and enhancement, that do not fit to the programming flow and style RapidBATCH 4 provided.<br /><br />

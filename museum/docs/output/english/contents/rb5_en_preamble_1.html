		Welcome to RapidBATCH!<br /><br />RapidBATCH is a popular scripting language for Windows&reg; platforms, which goal is the fast and uncomplicated solution of smaller and median software-problems today's computer users are dealing with. For this, RapidBATCH follows its own, simple philosophy: Getting a great result with less of coding effort!<br /><br />Already the following, two lines are representing an adequate, in RapidBATCH implemented software-program.<br /><br /><!-- code BEGIN --><div class="code">echo <font color="#0000ff">'Hello World'</font><br /><b>end</b></div><!-- code END--><!--Indeed, many RapidBATCH programs - the so called scripts - are hold very plainly, but under the &quot;engine hood&quot; of the scripts, very effective and powerful mechanism are used, making their usage very versatile and efficient. Nearly every software-problem can be solved within a couple of minutes using RapidBATCH - it is just a question of the implementation.<br /><br />-->RapidBATCH provides everything you need for the quick development of smaller and greater programs (and especially for extended batch file programming): Files can be created, read, written, copied, moved, renamed and deleted, file permissions and file dates can be read and changed, external programs can be executed in different modes, the registry can be modified and read, Windows&reg; can be shut down or locked, programs can be controlled remotely, mouse-clicks and movements can be simulated, multimedia files like MP3, AVI or MIDI can be played, documents and internet-urls can be called and opened.<br /><br />Additionally, RapidBATCH provides you 10 build-in dialog windows for different user-interaction possibilites that can be directly used in every script. Using over 12 different window controls, you're also able to create and program your very own, completely individual dialogs, enabling you to implement any desired user interface you wish into your scripts and applications.<br /><br />As a modern, procedural programming language, RapidBATCH provides also on the technical level all you need to implement powerful tools and applications with less programming effort: A clearly structured and flexible syntax, easy learnable statements and functions, iterations (loops), many build-in functions to operate with data, user-definable procedures and functions, recoursive programming (self-calling procedures), a completely, ultra dynamic variable system, featuring arrays with up to 9 sub-dimensions, and the possiblity of include-files, where different script code parts and procedure- or function-definitions can be separated into different files, that are assembled together virtually to one huge script at run-time.<br /><br />RapidBATCH is very easy to learn, both for programming beginners and for experienced users or software developers, who want to have a professional, fast and versatile scripting platform to their fingertips.<br />RapidBATCH scripts can be directly executed with a simple double-click on the script file, like at an EXE- or batchfile-program. No project directories or makefiles are required as they are known from huger software development environments.<br /><br />To execute scripts, RapidBATCH uses a script-interpreter, that reads the script's sources in plain text and directly executes them. For those programmers who want to pass and deploy their programs to other users, the fast RapidBATCH script-compiler can be used to compile the scripts into standalone, self-executable .EXE-files, that can be executed on any Windows&reg; platform without a RapidBATCH interpreter or development environment.<br /><br />Also when creating your scripts, RapidBATCH makes it as easy as possible: The included script-editor RapidBATCH Builder allows the comfortable editing and creation of RapidBATCH scripts, which can directly be executed and compiled from the editor. With the powerful script-debugger that is integrated into the RapidBATCH-interpreter, you can execute your scripts line-by-line to trace the program flow and watch or change to content of variables directly at run-time. Thus, RapidBATCH provides you an useful tool to find logical bugs in your scripts very quickly.<br /><br />This manual will introduce you step-by-step to the development of scripts in RapidBATCH 5. Because RapidBATCH has grown to a handsome and powerful programming language now, this manual will only discuss the most important elements and language features. In addition, the detailed language reference manual provides an excellent appendix to the scripting language, describing all functions and statements RapidBATCH is featuring, including a full description and examples.<br /><br />Now, we wish you much fun and success with RapidBATCH! Thank you, that you decided to use RapidBATCH for your scripting ideas.<br /><br />
